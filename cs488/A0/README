Now build the bundled libraries. They have different build processes, but we've provided a quick way to get it all done at once:
	cd cs488
	cs488$ premake4 gmake
	cs488$ make

Now go into the A0/ directory and build the skeleton code:

  cs488$ cd A0
  cs488/A0$ premake4 gmake
  cs488/A0$ make


Launch Application using:
  cs488/A0$ ./A0
